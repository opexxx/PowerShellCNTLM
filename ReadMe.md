PowerShell CNTLM
-

This PowerShell Module wraps the [CNTLM](http://cntlm.sourceforge.net/) tool (not included). The aim of the module is to make using CNTLM from PowerShell a breeze.

Notices
-

This is very early work. At this point I'm running with scissors. Use at your own risk! Consider yourself warned!

Install
-

To install in your personal modules folder (e.g. ~\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules), run:

```powershell
iex (new-object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.github.com/DamianReeves/PowerShellCNTLM/master/Install.ps1')
```
